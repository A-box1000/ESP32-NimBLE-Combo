# ESP32 BLE Combo Keyboard & Mouse library

This library allows you to make the ESP32 act as a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse with Arduino. This library also uses NimBLE so you can also use a wifi stack without running out of storage.

## Installation
- (Make sure you can use the ESP32 with the Arduino IDE. [Instructions can be found here.](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32#installation-instructions))
- [Download the code from this github repository]
- In the Arduino IDE go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .ZIP Library..." and select the file you just downloaded.
- You can now go to "File" -> "Examples" -> "ESP32 BLE Combo" and select any of the examples to get started.

## Credits

This is fork of @T-kV's excellent [ESP32-BLE-Mouse](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Mouse)
and [ESP32-BLE-Keyboard](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard) libraries.

I personally added NimBLE support to both libraries.
